		"author": "<h1 class=\"text-center text-3xl sm:text-5xl my-5\">About the author</h1><p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl mb-4\"><strong>Luis Villegas</strong> learnt algorithms and data structures with the C++ programming language in college back in 2017. Since then, he has not stopped learning technologies and programming languages mostly related to the web, with great online course platforms such as <strong>W3Schools</strong> and <strong>FreeCodeCamp</strong>, where he learnt <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and modern <strong>JavaScript</strong> with <strong>React and Redux</strong>. He quickly became a web developer for both server-side and client-side applications, with the Golang programming language for the backend and React and Redux or Svelte for the frontend, or simply HTML, CSS and JS with HUGO for static sites.</p><p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl\">This application is a demonstration of his skills as a web developer. The API, built with Golang is running on an AWS EC2 instance and the frontend, which supports i18n, is built with React and Redux and is being hosted on Netlify.</p>",
		"contact": "<p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl\">You can get in touch with him through his email: luisguveal@gmail.com or his LinkedIn profile: <a href='https://linkedin.com/in/luisg-villegas' rel='noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://linkedin.com/in/luisg-villegas</a></p>",
		"intro1": "<p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl\"><strong>DollarBlacklist</strong> is a reputation system for <em>USD</em> currency bills, where users can query banknotes by their serial number, value and series year, and immediately see a summary of the reviews that other users have made on the banknote, and thus determine with the greatest possible security the <strong>authenticity</strong> of the bill.</p>",
		"intro2": "<p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl\">In addition to providing a summary of reviews made by other users, DollarBlacklist lists the <strong>security features</strong> that the bill consulted should have, and how to use them to determine whether the bill is real or counterfeit.</p>",
		"motivation": "<h1 class=\"text-center text-3xl sm:text-5xl my-5\">Motivation</h1><p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl\">Many people don't really know how to spot fake bills by inspecting their security features. The official website of the US currency does list them in several PDF files, but that's not the most practical way to learn all the security features from all the denominations from all the series years.</p> <p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl\">Counterfeit bill detectors already exist, but they are an overkill for something that could be easily done by humans simply by analizing the security features. They were created for a reason: to make replicating them very difficult and expensive, and not everyone can afford to buy one of those machines, which are not as portable as smartphones.</p>",
		"reviews": "<h2 class=\"text-center text-2xl sm:text-4xl my-5\">Reviews</h2><p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl\">There are two types of reviews:</p><ul class=\"list-disc mb-4\"><li class=\"text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold\">Good review: authentic banknotes<p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl\">Users can leave an optional public comment and must specify a number from 1 to 5, which refers to the physical conditions of the banknote.</p></li><li class=\"text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold\">Bad review: counterfeit banknotes<p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl\">Users can leave an optional public comment and must specify the defects of the banknote that are considered a failure in the security features.</p></li></ul>",
		"reviewsNotes": "<p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl\"><strong>Important:</strong> in order to submit reviews, users must allow DollarBlacklist to know their location, since this information is an essential part of the review, and is used to position on a map the city where the review was performed.</p><p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl\">A user is only allowed to submit one review of one type (good or bad) of a single banknote.</p>",
		"securityFeatures": "<h2 class=\"text-center text-2xl sm:text-4xl my-5\">About the security features</h2><p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl\">Each banknote denomination has different security features, which vary depending on the series year.</p><p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl\">All information regarding the security features of the banknotes of each denomination of each serial year has been obtained from the <em>official website of the U.S. currency</em>: <a href='https://www.uscurrency.gov'>www.uscurrency.gov</a></p>",
		"users": "<h2 class=\"text-center text-2xl sm:text-4xl my-5\">Types of users</h2><p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl\">There are two types of users:</p><ul class=\"list-disc\"><li class=\"text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold\">Regular</li><li class=\"text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold\">Business</li></ul><p class=\"text-left text-xl sm:text-2xl\">The only difference between both types of users is that the reviews made by <strong>businesses</strong> in general are more reliable than those made by <strong>regular users</strong>.</p>"
